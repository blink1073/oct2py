## 5.2.0 (2020-08-05)

- Add \_get_max_nout and alternative nout mode using 'max_nout'
  (#170)

## 5.1.0 (2020-04-25)

  was hiding similar user-errors (#161)

## 5.0.0 (2019-05-03)

\- Removed the `executable` argument to `Oct2Py` in favor of using
environment variables because we need to instantiate the `octave`
convenience instance at startup.

## 4.3.0 (2019-05-02)

- Add a plot_backend kwarg for eval and clean up default backend
  selection.

## 4.2.0 (2019-04-28)

- Remove unwanted octave-workspace files at exit (#133)

## 4.1.0 (2019-04-23)

## 4.0.5 (2017-04-08)

- Fixed a thread safety bug when writing matlab files.

## 4.0.0 (2017-03-07)

### Features

- Added an `feval` method, which can be used to call Octave functions
  without creating a dynamic function. The function also supports
  calling a function by path.
- The new `feval` method and the dynamic functions both now support a
  `store_as` argument, which saves the result of the call to the
  Octave workspace rather than returning it.
- Added `get_pointer` method that can be used to retrieve a pointer to
  a value in the Octave namespace, including Octave functions.
  Pointers can be passed to `feval` or dynamic functions as function
  arguments. A pointer passed as a nested value will be passed by
  value instead.
- Added an Oct2Py `Cell` ndarray subclass used for Octave cell arrays.
- Added an Oct2PY `StructArray` numpy `recarray` subclass used for
  Octave structure arrays.
- Added a `stream_handler` argument to `eval` and the new `feval`
  method that can be used to capture streaming output using a simple
  callback.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed inferred `nout` for Octave function calls; it must be
  explicitly given if not `1`. The old behavior was too surprising and
  relied on internal logic of the CPython interpreter.
- Any code that received Cell or Struct Array values will need to be
  updated.
- Numpy booleans are now equivalent to Octave literals. They were
  previously handled as uint8 when sending to Octave.
- Deprecated the use of keyword arguments to Octave function calls,
  use standard Octave calling conventions.
- Deprecated the `log` and \[return_both\]{.title-ref} keyword arguments
  to `eval()`. See docs on `Oct2Py.eval()` for more information.
- Oct2Py will no longer create dynamic functions for values that are
  not Octave functions - use \[get_pointer\]{.title-ref} or `pull`
  instead.

## 3.9.0 (2017-01-28)

- Added support for Python 3.6 and Octave \[input()\]{.title-ref}
  functions.

## 3.8.0 (2016-12-25)

- Added support for Octave class objects and clean up repr() and
  help() for dynamic Octave methods, (PR #104)

## 3.7.0 (2016-12-24)

- Fixed error that caused the session to crash on Windows when Octave
  encountered a syntax error.
- Added separate width and height specifiers to the
  \[%%octave\]{.title-ref} magic so the image can be constrained in one
  dimension while maintaining its aspect ratio.
- Added an \[extract_figures\]{.title-ref} method to the
  \[Oct2Py\]{.title-ref} class which gives back a list of IPython Image
  or SVG objects for the created figures.
- Completely rewrote the internal communication to Octave on top of
  the \[octave_kernel\]{.title-ref}, which enabled the Windows crash
  fix.
- Removed the internal \[\_make_figs.m\]{.title-ref} file, since that
  functionality is now in \[octave_kernel\]{.title-ref}.

## 3.6.1 (2016-11-20)

- More plot creation cleanup - fault tolerance for svg files.

## 3.6.0 (2016-11-20)

- Cleanup of plot creation - separate \_make_figs.m file

## 2.4.2 (2014-12-19)

- Add support for Octave 3.8 on Windows

## 2.4.1 (2014-10-22)

- Prevent zombie octave processes.

## 2.4.0 (2014-09-27)

- Make \[eval\]{.title-ref} output match Octave session output. If
  verbose=True, print all Octave output. Return the last "ans" from
  Octave, if available. If you need the response, use
  \[return_both\]{.title-ref} to get the \[(resp, ans)\]{.title-ref} pair
  back
- As a result of the previous, Syntax Errors in Octave code will now
  result in a closed session on Windows.
- Fix sizing of plots when in inline mode.
- Numerous corner case bug fixes.

## 2.3.0 (2014-09-14)

- Fix handling of cell magic with inline comments.

## 2.2.0 (2014-09-14)

## 2.1.0 (2014-08-23)

- Allow keyword arguments in functions: \[octave.plot(\[1,2,3\],
  linewidth=2))\]{.title-ref} These are translated to ("prop", value)
  arguments to the function.
- Add option to show plotting gui with \[-g\]{.title-ref} flag in
  OctaveMagic.
- Add ability to specify the Octave executable as a keyword argument
  to the Oct2Py object.
  - Add specifications for plot saving instead of displaying plots
    to \[eval\]{.title-ref} and dynamic functions.

## 2.0.0 (2014-08-14)

\- **Breaking changes**

: -- Removed methods: \[run\]{.title-ref}, \[call\]{.title-ref},
\[lookfor\]{.title-ref} -- Renamed methods: \[\_eval\]{.title-ref} ->
\[eval\]{.title-ref}, \[get\]{.title-ref} -> \[pull\]{.title-ref},
\[put\]{.title-ref} -> \[push\]{.title-ref}, \[close\]{.title-ref} ->
\[exit\]{.title-ref} -- Removed run and call in favor of using eval
dynamic functions. -- Renamed methods to avoid overshadowing Octave
builtins and for clarity. -- When a command results in "ans", the
value of "ans" is returned instead of the printed string.
