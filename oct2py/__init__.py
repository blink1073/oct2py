"""
Oct2Py is a means to seamlessly call M-files and GNU Octave functions from
Python.
It manages the Octave session for you, sharing data behind the scenes using
MAT files.  Usage is as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import oct2py
    >>> oc = oct2py.Oct2Py()
    >>> x = oc.zeros(3,3)
    >>> print(x, x.dtype.str)  # doctest: +SKIP
    [[ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]] <f8

If you want to run legacy m-files, do not have MATLAB(TM), and do not fully
trust a code translator, this is your library.
